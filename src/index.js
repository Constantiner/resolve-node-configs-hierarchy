/**
 * Returns a list of absolute file paths of existing files in the order to apply from first to last (in order of precedence).
 *
 * **Note** To use in Node environment, not in browser.
 *
 * The base idea is [the following](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv#what-other-env-files-can-i-use).
 *
 * It will list the following files, starting from the bottom. The first value set (or those already defined in the environment)
 * take precedence:
 *
 * * `.env` - The Original速
 * * `.env.development`, `.env.test`, `.env.production` - Environment-specific settings.
 * * `.env.local` - Local overrides. This file is loaded for all environments except test
 * (you can include it with flag as the second parameter).
 * * `.env.development.local`, `.env.test.local` (for `test` environment
 * you can include it with flag as the second parameter), `.env.production.local` -
 * Local overrides of environment-specific settings.
 *
 * It uses `process.env.NODE_ENV` for setting environment.
 *
 * For test environment it will not list `.env.local` and `.env.test.local` from this list by default
 * since normally you expect tests to produce the same results for everyone.
 * You can include them by passing the second parameter with `true` value.
 *
 * It may use any relative path as the base path even with extension.
 *
 * for example if you pass `"configuration/log4js.json"` it will produce the following list for development environment
 * (if all of these files are exist in file system):
 *
 * * `<project_path>/configuration/log4js.development.local.json`
 * * `<project_path>/configuration/log4js.local.json`
 * * `<project_path>/configuration/log4js.development.json`
 * * `<project_path>/configuration/log4js.json`
 *
 * This utility is asynchronous and returns a promise resolving to file list.
 * Use `getConfigFilesSync` for synchronous version.
 *
 * This utility was inspired by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
 * and may contain some chunks of code from it.
 *
 * @param {string} file Relative path (from project root) to base file location (for example "config/.env").
 * @param {boolean} [includeTestLocals=false] Default to false. If true it includes files with "local" in name for test environment.
