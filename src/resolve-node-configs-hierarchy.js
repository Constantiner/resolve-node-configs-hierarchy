/**
 * Returns a list of absolute file paths of existing files in the order to apply from first to last
 * (in order of precedence).
 *
 * The base idea is the following https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv#what-other-env-files-can-i-use
 *
 * It will list the following files, starting from the bottom.
 * The first value set (or those already defined in the environment) take precedence:
 * .env - The OriginalÂ®
 * .env.development, .env.test, .env.production - Environment-specific settings.
 * .env.local - Local overrides. This file is loaded for all environments except test.
 * .env.development.local, .env.test.local, .env.production.local - Local overrides of environment-specific settings.
 *
 * It uses process.env.NODE_ENV for setting environment.
 *
 * For test environment it will not list .env.local from this list
 * since normally you expect tests to produce the same results for everyone.
 *
 * It may use any relative path as the base path even with extension.
 *
 * for example if you pass "configuration/log4js.json" it will produce the following list for development environment
 * (if all of these files are exist in file system):
 * <project_path>/configuration/log4js.development.local.json
 * <project_path>/configuration/log4js.local.json
 * <project_path>/configuration/log4js.development.json
 * <project_path>/configuration/log4js.json
 *
 * This utility is asynchronous and returns a promise resolving to file list.
 *
 * This utility was inspired by https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app and may contain some chunks of code from it.
 *
 * @param {string} file Relative path (from project root) to base file location (for example "config/.env").
 * @returns {Promise<Array>} A promise resolving to array of absolute file names.
 *
